# 23 — Real-World Git, Debugging & Mastery

## Mission

Integrate the entire course through unfamiliar repositories, documentation, debugging, release markers, collaboration, recovery, and independent work.

## Learning outcomes

- unfamiliar repositories
- documentation missions
- Git debugging
- history and diff investigation
- tags and releases
- collaboration
- recovery
- final mastery

## The mental model

Before learning the commands for **Real-World Git, Debugging & Mastery**, understand the problem they solve. Git operations are safest when you can describe the current state and the desired state in ordinary language first.

### The core loop

#### Why this matters

The final skill is independent decision-making: investigate, choose, act, verify, and recover.

In this section, treat **The core loop** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

#### Step-by-step thinking

1. **Describe the goal in plain language.** Do not start with a command.
2. **Inspect the current state.** Use the information Git already provides.
3. **Predict the result.** Write down what you expect to happen.
4. **Perform the smallest appropriate operation.** Avoid unrelated changes.
5. **Read Git's output.** It often tells you what happened or what is required next.
6. **Verify the result.** Check the repository state, files, history, or project behavior as appropriate.

#### Example situation

Imagine a teammate asks you to deal with a problem involving **the core loop**. You have not been given a command recipe. Your first response should be investigation: determine the current state, identify the desired state, and find the relevant documentation if you need syntax or options.

A useful written plan is:

```text
Goal:
Current state:
Evidence I have:
Operation I am considering:
What I expect:
How I will verify:
```

#### What beginners often get wrong

- Starting with a command instead of a goal.
- Assuming the current branch or repository location.
- Treating an error message as a reason to panic instead of information.
- Running several commands before checking the result of the first one.
- Using a destructive option because a random tutorial recommended it.
- Declaring success because a command returned without an error.

#### Verification checklist

- [ ] I know what state I started in.
- [ ] I know what I intended to change.
- [ ] I can explain what the operation changed.
- [ ] I checked the resulting Git state.
- [ ] I checked the actual project result when relevant.
- [ ] I can explain what I would do if the result were unexpected.


```text
UNDERSTAND
   ↓
INSPECT
   ↓
PREDICT
   ↓
ACT
   ↓
VERIFY
```

If the result is not what you expected:

```text
STOP → INSPECT → UNDERSTAND → RECOVER → VERIFY
```

### What you should already know

#### Why this matters

The final skill is independent decision-making: investigate, choose, act, verify, and recover.

Shows repository state, including branch and reported changes.

### `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`

#### Why this matters

The final skill is independent decision-making: investigate, choose, act, verify, and recover.

In this section, treat **`git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

#### Step-by-step thinking

1. **Describe the goal in plain language.** Do not start with a command.
2. **Inspect the current state.** Use the information Git already provides.
3. **Predict the result.** Write down what you expect to happen.
4. **Perform the smallest appropriate operation.** Avoid unrelated changes.
5. **Read Git's output.** It often tells you what happened or what is required next.
6. **Verify the result.** Check the repository state, files, history, or project behavior as appropriate.

#### Example situation

Imagine a teammate asks you to deal with a problem involving **`git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`**. You have not been given a command recipe. Your first response should be investigation: determine the current state, identify the desired state, and find the relevant documentation if you need syntax or options.

A useful written plan is:

#### What beginners often get wrong

- Starting with a command instead of a goal.
- Assuming the current branch or repository location.
- Treating an error message as a reason to panic instead of information.
- Running several commands before checking the result of the first one.
- Using a destructive option because a random tutorial recommended it.
- Declaring success because a command returned without an error.

#### Verification checklist

- [ ] I know what state I started in.
- [ ] I know what I intended to change.
- [ ] I can explain what the operation changed.
- [ ] I checked the resulting Git state.
- [ ] I checked the actual project result when relevant.
- [ ] I can explain what I would do if the result were unexpected.

Git often tells you exactly what happened or what it expects next. Read the complete message.

## What you should be able to explain

- [ ] I can explain **unfamiliar repositories** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **documentation missions** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **Git debugging** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **history and diff investigation** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **tags and releases** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **collaboration** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **recovery** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **final mastery** in my own words.

## Mastery checkpoint

You should be able to complete the real-world git, debugging & mastery practice drills without being given a command-by-command recipe. If you forget a command, use documentation and your understanding of repository state to find it.

## Learning a command instead of memorising a command

For every new command, answer these questions:

1. **What problem does it solve?**
2. **What repository state should I be in before using it?**
3. **What does it change?**
4. **What does it not change?**
5. **What could go wrong?**
6. **How can I undo or recover if necessary?**
7. **How do I verify the result?**

If you cannot answer these questions, you are not ready to use an advanced option blindly. Look it up.

## Documentation habit

The course intentionally does not require you to remember every option. When you forget syntax:

```text
Remember the goal
      ↓
Inspect the state
      ↓
Search official documentation
      ↓
Read the relevant example/options
      ↓
Understand before executing
      ↓
Run the smallest safe operation
      ↓
Verify
```

## Prediction drill

Choose one operation from this lesson. Before running it, write:

```text
I am currently: __________________________
I want: __________________________________
I think Git will: ________________________
If I am wrong, I will first: ______________
I will verify by: _________________________
```

Then perform the operation and compare the actual result with the prediction. A wrong prediction is not a failure; it is evidence that your mental model needs improvement.

## Break-it principle

Practice difficult Git operations in a disposable repository. A safe practice environment lets you experience errors, conflicts, recovery, and history changes without risking important work.

Never turn a practice exercise into an experiment on an important production repository.

## Mastery interview

Explain this lesson to someone who has never used Git. Do not begin with commands. Begin with the problem Git is solving. Then explain the mental model, the normal workflow, the common mistake, and the verification step.

If you can explain the concept clearly without relying on command names, you understand it better than if you can merely type the command.

## The assessment repository

Use the official **PaakowTronics Service Desk Final Mastery** repository:

**https://github.com/PaakowTronics/paakowtronics-service-desk-final-mastery**

It was created specifically for learners who have studied **Git Essentials**. The repository contains a realistic Service Desk scenario, existing history, multiple branches, documentation, a prepared integration problem, remote-tracking information, and an instructor-controlled recovery exercise.

## What to do

1. Open the repository and read its `README.md`.
2. Read `FINAL-MASTERY-CHALLENGE.md`.
3. Follow the documented setup process.
4. Work through the challenge without asking for a command-by-command recipe.
5. Use Git documentation and the repository documentation when you need information.
6. Inspect and verify your work throughout the assessment.

The goal is not to remember every Git command. The goal is to demonstrate that you can **investigate a real repository, make reasoned decisions, perform Git operations, recover from mistakes, and prove the final state is correct.**

## The handoff from the course to the assessment

When you reach the assessment, resist the temptation to search for a command first. Start by reading the repository's instructions and determining the state you have been given.
