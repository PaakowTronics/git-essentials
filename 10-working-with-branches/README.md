# 10 — Working With Branches

## Mission

Create, inspect, switch, use, and safely remove branches.

## Learning outcomes

- branch listing
- creating branches
- switching
- current branch
- branch-specific work
- branch naming
- safe deletion

## The mental model

Before learning the commands for **Working With Branches**, understand the problem they solve. Git operations are safest when you can describe the current state and the desired state in ordinary language first.

### The core loop

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **The core loop** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

#### Step-by-step thinking

1. **Describe the goal in plain language.** Do not start with a command.
2. **Inspect the current state.** Use the information Git already provides.
3. **Predict the result.** Write down what you expect to happen.
4. **Perform the smallest appropriate operation.** Avoid unrelated changes.
5. **Read Git's output.** It often tells you what happened or what is required next.
6. **Verify the result.** Check the repository state, files, history, or project behavior as appropriate.

#### Example situation

Imagine a teammate asks you to deal with a problem involving **the core loop**. You have not been given a command recipe. Your first response should be investigation: determine the current state, identify the desired state, and find the relevant documentation if you need syntax or options.

A useful written plan is:

```text
Goal:
Current state:
Evidence I have:
Operation I am considering:
What I expect:
How I will verify:
```

#### What beginners often get wrong

- Starting with a command instead of a goal.
- Assuming the current branch or repository location.
- Treating an error message as a reason to panic instead of information.
- Running several commands before checking the result of the first one.
- Using a destructive option because a random tutorial recommended it.
- Declaring success because a command returned without an error.

#### Verification checklist

- [ ] I know what state I started in.
- [ ] I know what I intended to change.
- [ ] I can explain what the operation changed.
- [ ] I checked the resulting Git state.
- [ ] I checked the actual project result when relevant.
- [ ] I can explain what I would do if the result were unexpected.


```text
UNDERSTAND
   ↓
INSPECT
   ↓
PREDICT
   ↓
ACT
   ↓
VERIFY
```

If the result is not what you expected:

```text
STOP → INSPECT → UNDERSTAND → RECOVER → VERIFY
```

## Before you begin

### What you should already know

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **What you should already know** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

#### Step-by-step thinking

1. **Describe the goal in plain language.** Do not start with a command.
2. **Inspect the current state.** Use the information Git already provides.
3. **Predict the result.** Write down what you expect to happen.
4. **Perform the smallest appropriate operation.** Avoid unrelated changes.
5. **Read Git's output.** It often tells you what happened or what is required next.

1. **Describe the goal in plain language.** Do not start with a command.
2. **Inspect the current state.** Use the information Git already provides.
3. **Predict the result.** Write down what you expect to happen.
4. **Perform the smallest appropriate operation.** Avoid unrelated changes.
5. **Read Git's output.** It often tells you what happened or what is required next.
6. **Verify the result.** Check the repository state, files, history, or project behavior as appropriate.

#### Example situation

Imagine a teammate asks you to deal with a problem involving **`git branch -d <name>`**. You have not been given a command recipe. Your first response should be investigation: determine the current state, identify the desired state, and find the relevant documentation if you need syntax or options.

A useful written plan is:

```text
Goal:
Current state:
Evidence I have:
Operation I am considering:
What I expect:
How I will verify:
```

#### What beginners often get wrong

- Starting with a command instead of a goal.
- Assuming the current branch or repository location.
- Treating an error message as a reason to panic instead of information.
- Running several commands before checking the result of the first one.
- Using a destructive option because a random tutorial recommended it.
- Declaring success because a command returned without an error.

#### Verification checklist

- [ ] I know what state I started in.
- [ ] I know what I intended to change.
- [ ] I can explain what the operation changed.
- [ ] I checked the resulting Git state.
- [ ] I checked the actual project result when relevant.
- [ ] I can explain what I would do if the result were unexpected.

## Common mistakes and troubleshooting

### Running commands in the wrong folder

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **Running commands in the wrong folder** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

Use `pwd`, `ls`, and `git status` before changing repository configuration.

### Acting before checking state

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **Acting before checking state** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

Stop and inspect status. Git usually gives you enough information to decide the next step.

### Copying a command without understanding it

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **Copying a command without understanding it** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

A command can succeed while the project remains logically wrong. Test and inspect the result.

### Using a destructive operation casually

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

In this section, treat **Using a destructive operation casually** as a real situation rather than a command to memorise. Ask what problem exists, what information Git already has, what you want to change, and how you will prove the result.

Preserve important work and understand what will be discarded or rewritten before running it.

### Forgetting the current branch

#### Why this matters

Branch commands change where future commits belong. Verify your current branch before important work.

Git often tells you exactly what happened or what it expects next. Read the complete message.

## What you should be able to explain

- [ ] I can explain **branch listing** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **creating branches** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **switching** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **current branch** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **branch-specific work** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **branch naming** in my own words.
- [ ] I can explain **safe deletion** in my own words.

## Mastery checkpoint

You should be able to complete the working with branches practice drills without being given a command-by-command recipe. If you forget a command, use documentation and your understanding of repository state to find it.

## Learning a command instead of memorising a command

For every new command, answer these questions:

1. **What problem does it solve?**
2. **What repository state should I be in before using it?**
3. **What does it change?**
4. **What does it not change?**
5. **What could go wrong?**
6. **How can I undo or recover if necessary?**
7. **How do I verify the result?**

If you cannot answer these questions, you are not ready to use an advanced option blindly. Look it up.

## Documentation habit

The course intentionally does not require you to remember every option. When you forget syntax:

```text
Remember the goal
      ↓
Inspect the state
      ↓
Search official documentation
      ↓
Read the relevant example/options
      ↓
Understand before executing
      ↓
Run the smallest safe operation
      ↓
Verify
```

## Prediction drill

Choose one operation from this lesson. Before running it, write:

```text
I am currently: __________________________
I want: __________________________________
I think Git will: ________________________
If I am wrong, I will first: ______________
I will verify by: _________________________
```

Then perform the operation and compare the actual result with the prediction. A wrong prediction is not a failure; it is evidence that your mental model needs improvement.

## Break-it principle

Practice difficult Git operations in a disposable repository. A safe practice environment lets you experience errors, conflicts, recovery, and history changes without risking important work.

Never turn a practice exercise into an experiment on an important production repository.

## Mastery interview

Explain this lesson to someone who has never used Git. Do not begin with commands. Begin with the problem Git is solving. Then explain the mental model, the normal workflow, the common mistake, and the verification step.

If you can explain the concept clearly without relying on command names, you understand it better than if you can merely type the command.
